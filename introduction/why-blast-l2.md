# Why Blast(L2) ?

## \[Un-Official:]

\[You know it and we know it. Blur's team can execute extremely well, they've proven this many times.  The current TVL already tells you everything you need to know.

What strikes us is that they have added a massive! change to the DeFi infra on their chain. It creates many new dynamics and potential products out of thin air. This is a very risky move, but one that was needed. People don't realize that most blockchains launch with minimal or no changes to the base infrastructure, usually, it's centred around speed, some UX features etc, but this is different, it's a core utility difference.

Blast set itself up for an organic W. It has the fundamentals to act as a black hole of assets across a lot of other chains and idle assets on ETH.&#x20;

With all of this in mind, we believe that Blast will win and we are positioning ourselves to become one of the projects on Blast, aggregating users and TVL into an explosive mix for the $OFF growth.

For research purposes, we highly suggest reading a [Blast overview](https://www.standardcrypto.vc/thoughts/blast-the-layer-two-opportunity/) by one of their investors - StandardCrypto. ]

## _Official version:_&#x20;

## _1. Native Yield_

_Blast is an innovative Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution designed to enhance user earnings and revolutionise the DeFi landscape. It stands out as the only L2 offering native yield for ETH and stablecoins, with an automatic compounding feature that sets it apart from traditional L2s. Blast's impressive 4% yield for ETH and 5% for stablecoins challenge the 0% default interest rate found on other L2s, providing users a lucrative opportunity to earn passive income._

## _2. Auto Rebasing, L1 Staking and T-Bill Yield._

_Blast's groundbreaking mechanics include Auto Rebasing, ensuring ETH yield is automatically transferred to users, and USDB, Blast's auto-rebasing stablecoin, which derives its yield from MakerDAO's on-chain T-Bill protocol. This innovative design positions Blast as an EVM-compatible, optimistic rollup that raises the baseline yield and preserves a familiar experience for crypto natives._

## _3. Importance of Protocols_

_Blast presents an unprecedented opportunity for developers to build with yield, offering native yield for ETH and stablecoins. This opens doors to new revenue streams and rewards for end-users. As an EVM-compatible L2, developers can seamlessly transition to Blast without extensive retooling, ensuring compatibility with existing code, tools, and infrastructure. Additionally, Blast stands out by programmatically returning gas fee revenue to developers, setting it apart from other L2s that retain this revenue for themselves. Blast represents a paradigm shift in the DeFi ecosystem, delivering 10x more value and encouraging developers to embrace a platform designed for maximum yield and user benefit._
