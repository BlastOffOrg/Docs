# YIDO - Native Yield IDO

## **Native Yield IDOs: A game-changer for the funding space**

Native Yield IDOs (YIDOs) are a revolutionary new type of initial decentralized offering (IDO) that combines the traditional concept of IDOs with the innovative concept of native yield. In a nutshell, Native Yield IDOs allow users to participate in IDOs without the risk of losing their investment. This is achieved by allocating a portion of the yield generated from staking ETH or stablecoins on the BlastOff platform to support YIDOs.

This fully automated system creates the first-ever idle IDO earning system. Set it up once and get tokens airdropped to you regularly.

## **How do Native Yield IDOs work?**

Here's a simplified breakdown of how Native Yield IDOs work for regular users:

1. **Stake ETH or stablecoins:** Users can stake their ETH or stablecoins on the BlastOff platform directly or through YZone, the platform's yield aggregator. Staking involves locking up your tokens for a specified period to earn yield.
2. **Allocate yield to YIDOs:** A portion of the yield generated from staking is automatically allocated to support YIDOs launched on Blastoff. This means that users contribute a portion of their earnings to fund new crypto projects. Users decide what % of future yield they want to allocate towards YIDOs.
3. **Participate in YIDOs:** When a YIDO is launched on Blastoff, a portion of the yield automatically gets used in the YIDO. Project tokens then get auto-airdropped during TGE.&#x20;
4. **Zero-risk investment:** The key advantage of Native Yield IDOs is that users are not at risk of losing their investment. Only a portion of future yield is dedicated towards the projects.&#x20;

## **TL**;**DR YIDOs offer:**

* **Zero-risk investment:** Unlike traditional IDOs, where users risk losing their investment if the project fails, Native Yield IDOs offer a zero-risk approach.
* **Passive income generation:** Users earn a yield on their staked ETH or stablecoins, even while participating in YIDOs. Forget about FCFS and IDO timing hassles.
* **Early access to promising projects:** Users can invest in promising new crypto projects early on, potentially benefiting from significant price appreciation.
* **Diversified investment portfolio:** Native Yield IDOs provide a way to diversify one's investment portfolio by participating in multiple YIDOs across different sectors of the crypto ecosystem.
