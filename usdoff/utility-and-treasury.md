# Utility and Treasury

$OFF

$OFF is the native utility token of the BlastOff product ecosystem.&#x20;

Initially launched on Ethereum, it will later be bridged over to Blast. For the purpose of a future bridge, the token will be created using the Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) LayerZero standard.&#x20;

## Utilities

$OFF utilities were created to share value to the most active and loyal participants of the BlastOff ecosystem. To receive the benefits of $OFF utility, users must stake them, enabling their Blast Force Score.&#x20;

1. YIDOs - Higher allocation, ability to manually participate in YIDOs
2. Native Blast Staking - Lower fees
3. YZone - Higher yield and lower fees
4. Governance - Vote on curating the YZone Vaults and the YIDO deal flow.
5. Community Incentives - Active participation will be rewarded via $OFF
6. Treasury Revenue Share - Treasury growth accumulation will be shared, with distribution geared towards users with higher Blast Force scores.&#x20;

## Treasury

Treasury will be used to provide constant additional revenue to the $OFF stakers.&#x20;

During the IDO, 10% of the funds raised will go towards the Genesis Treasury. Genesis Treasury fund will be staked towards the Blast Network.&#x20;

After the $OFF IDO, the Treasury will capture:&#x20;

1. Native Rebasing Yield
2. 30% of YIDO Fees
3. 50% of YZone Fees
4. 100% of all future Airdrops.&#x20;

Every Quarter, 30% of Treasury growth, meaning the delta between Treasury's Total Asset Value at the beginning of the Quarter to the end of it, will be airdropped to the top 10% of users with the highest Blast Force score.

In the case of Treasury dissolution or partial liquidation. 50% of all Treasury value will be distributed towards the top 50% of all $OFF Stakers. &#x20;

$OFF tokens within the Treasury will be subject to a different rule set. They will not be counted as value in Total Asset Value calculations, and the available $OFF tokens will be burned in the case of dissolution or partial liquidation.&#x20;
